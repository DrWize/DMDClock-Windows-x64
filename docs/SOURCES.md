# Original resources and references

This file preserves important project links between work sessions. The project's README, documentation, and PowerShell scripts may link to the original resources. External files should be downloaded locally and must not be committed to this GitHub repository.

## Local resources

Local location: `external/`

The directory is ignored by Git. Run the repeatable download script from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/Get-OriginalResources.ps1
```

By default, the script downloads only missing repositories and leaves existing copies unchanged. Use `-Update` for fast-forward-only updates, `-Redownload` to replace clean existing copies with fresh shallow clones, or `-Resource DotClk-Resources` to select one or more named resources. `-WhatIf` previews clone, update, and redownload operations.

The script refuses to update dirty repositories or directories whose `origin` does not match the official catalog. It reports added, changed, deleted, and renamed files, and writes reproducibility data to the ignored files `external/original-resources-lock.json` and `external/original-resources-last-update.json`.

Network failures and changed repository locations are reported per resource. Other successfully processed repositories remain usable, and the report records the partial failure.
