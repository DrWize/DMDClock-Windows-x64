# DMDClock settings reference

Right-click anywhere on the DMD display to open the menu. A check mark means an
option is enabled or selected. The menu stays open while settings are changed and
closes when you click elsewhere or press `Escape`.

Settings are saved automatically to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\settings.json`. The normal application and screensaver use
the same settings.

## Scene library

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Open SCN file…** | Opens and plays one `.scn` file without changing the selected library folder. |
| **Choose animation folder…** | Selects and saves the active scene directory. Subdirectories are included. |
| **Download DotClk scenes…** | Downloads the original DotClk scene archive, safely installs only its `.scn` files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\Scenes\DotClk\`, and selects that library. |
| **Rescan library** | Detects new, changed, moved, removed, and damaged scene files. |
| **Review and choose scenes…** | Opens the live scene wall used to enable games and allow or disallow individual scenes. Shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+R`. |

DMDClock remembers the selected directory. Valid scenes remain available when
another file is damaged or unsupported.

### Scene Reviewer

The Scene Reviewer groups animations by game and plays every scene on the current
page simultaneously with the real clock compositor. The default `5 × 8` layout
shows 40 live scenes; the Columns and Rows controls independently support values
from 1 through 20.

![DMDClock Scene Reviewer showing 40 live scenes](screenshots/setup/scene-reviewer.png)

- Click an unreviewed or allowed scene to mark it **Disallowed**.
- Click a disallowed scene to mark it **Allowed** again.
- **Allow page** and **Disallow page** apply one decision to every visible scene.
- **Enable game for clock** controls whether that game's allowed scenes can play.
- Filters show all, unreviewed, allowed, or disallowed scenes.
- Page controls cover games with more scenes than the selected grid can display.
- **Pause all** freezes or resumes every visible preview.

Decisions are saved immediately to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\library-selections.json`. Only valid scenes explicitly
marked Allowed under an enabled game enter playback. Unreviewed and Disallowed
scenes do not play. The normal application and fullscreen screensaver use and
reload the same selection file.

Release years are shown beside a game only when the metadata contains one verified
year for that exact game identity. Missing or uncertain years are omitted.

The reviewer is available from the normal app and screensaver configuration mode.
Fullscreen screensaver playback stays control-free but observes the same saved
choices.

## Playback controls

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Play/pause** | Pauses or resumes the current display and animation timing. |
| **Next frame / Previous frame** | Moves one frame while viewing an animation. |
| **Next animation / Previous animation** | Loads another valid animation from the library. |
| **Random order** | Uses random animation selection. Turn it off for natural filename order. |
| **Automatic clock/animation cycle** | Alternates between the clock and animations automatically. |
| **Animation information** | Shows the game and sequence information briefly when playback begins. |

### Animations per cycle

Choose `1`, `3`, or `5`. This is the number of animations played before DMDClock
returns to the clock.

### Time between animations

Choose no pause, 5, 10, or 30 seconds. During a pause, DMDClock displays the clock
before continuing with the next animation in the same cycle.

## Appearance

### Color theme

Color themes change how the same four-bit DMD frame is displayed. They do not alter
the SCN file.

- **Classic orange**, **Red**, **Plasma**, and **Monochrome** are simple themes.
- **Neon sunset**, **Cyber ocean**, **Toxic arcade**, **Vaporwave**, and **Aurora**
  use horizontal color gradients.
- The C64 themes use fixed Commodore 64-inspired vertical raster colors.

Selecting a theme restores that theme's foreground treatment. A separately selected
background color is retained.

### Brightness

Choose 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%. Brightness affects the lit dots and glow. It does not
change the stored four-bit frame values.

### Glow

Adds or removes the soft light around each illuminated dot. Individual dots remain
separated in either mode.

### Foreground color

Opens an RGB/hex color picker for a custom dot color. A custom foreground replaces
the current theme foreground until another theme is selected.

### Background color

Opens an RGB/hex color picker for the display background. Use a dark background
that remains visibly different from the lit dots.

### Show title bar

Shows or hides the normal Windows title bar. A borderless window can still be moved
by left-dragging the display.

### Display size

- **Increase size/zoom** and `+` increase the window size or fullscreen DMD zoom.
- **Decrease size/zoom** and `-` decrease it.
- **Reset size/zoom** and `0` return the current mode to 100%.

Window size and fullscreen zoom are saved separately in 5% steps.

## Clock

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Show clock** | Immediately stops animation playback and displays the current time. |
| **Show seconds** | Adds or removes seconds from both 12- and 24-hour clocks. |
| **Clock duration** | Selects 10, 30, or 60 seconds before an automatic animation cycle starts. |
| **Time format** | Selects 24-hour time or 12-hour time with AM/PM. |
| **Font** | Selects the built-in font, an embedded DotClk font, or an installed OpenType font. |

Embedded clock fonts:

- ALTERN8
- FISHY
- TREK
- TWILIGHT

These original `.fnt` files are sourced from sigmafx's
[DotClk-Resources repository](https://github.com/sigmafx/DotClk-Resources) and are
currently embedded in DMDClock. See
[`assets/fonts/README.md`](../assets/fonts/README.md) for the source commit, hashes,
and license-status note.

Optional `.ttf` and `.otf` files can be placed anywhere below the `fonts` directory
beside the executable. Reopen the menu to refresh the font list.

## Date

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Show date** | Immediately displays the current date. |
| **Date format** | Selects `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, or `DD.MM.YYYY`. |
| **Font** | Selects a date font independently from the clock font. |

All four embedded DotClk fonts work with every date format. DMDClock supplies
dot-matrix separators when an original font does not contain the selected separator.

## Fullscreen

**Fullscreen** or `F11` fills the selected screen. Press `F11` or `Escape` to leave
fullscreen. The DMD remains centered and keeps its 4:1 aspect ratio.

## Language

Select English or Swedish. Translation files are loaded from `i18n` beside the
executable. English is the default.

If menu labels appear as internal keys, restore the `i18n` folder from the ZIP.

## Help and exit

- **Help – Alien Tech on GitHub** opens the project page.
- **Exit** closes the application cleanly.

## Default settings

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Automatic cycle | On |
| Playback order | Sequential |
| Clock duration | 30 seconds |
| Animations per cycle | 1 |
| Time between animations | No pause |

## Settings reset and backup

Close DMDClock before manually changing its files.

To back up the configuration, copy:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\
```

To reset preferences only, back up and remove `settings.json`. DMDClock creates a
new file with defaults the next time it starts. The scene library can then be chosen
again with `Ctrl+Shift+O`.
