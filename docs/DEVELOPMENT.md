# Local DMDClock development

Everything required to edit, run, review scenes, test, package, and publish
DMDClock runs locally. ChatGPT and other hosted AI services are optional.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 x64
- Git
- .NET 10 SDK
- PowerShell 7 recommended
- Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code with C# support
- Inno Setup 7 only when building the setup EXE

Check the command-line tools:

```powershell
git --version
dotnet --info
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

## Clone, restore, and run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DrWize/DMDClock-Windows-x64.git
Set-Location DMDClock-Windows-x64
dotnet restore DMDClock.sln
dotnet build DMDClock.sln -c Debug
dotnet run --project .\src\DmdClock.App\DmdClock.App.csproj
```

Open the Scene Reviewer directly:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\DmdClock.App\DmdClock.App.csproj -- /review
```

The reviewer, SCN decoding, rendering, clock compositor, file scanning, and
selection persistence all use the local CPU. No scene or preference data is sent
to an AI service.

## Test

```powershell
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release
```

Run a focused test while developing:

```powershell
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release --filter FullyQualifiedName~AnimationSelection
```

## Build distributable packages

Create the portable and standalone Windows packages:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Runtime win-x64 -NoStart
```

Create and validate the installer:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-Installer.ps1
.\scripts\Test-Installer.ps1
```

Build output is generated below `output\` and is intentionally excluded from Git.
Every package contains the tracked `scenes\scene-metadata.json`; downloaded `.scn`
animations are never packaged.

## Work with Git

Inspect before staging:

```powershell
git status
git diff
```

Commit one tested, coherent change:

```powershell
git add -p
git commit -m "Describe the completed change"
git push
```

A commit is a local snapshot. A push uploads local commits to GitHub. Commit after
a feature or fix is coherent and tested; push when it should be backed up, shared,
or released. Prefer explicit paths or `git add -p` when unrelated work is present.

## Local data

Runtime files remain under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\
```

- `settings.json` — application and screensaver preferences
- `library-index.json` — incremental scene index
- `library-selections.json` — shared game and scene decisions
- `logs\dmdclock.log` — diagnostics

Back up this directory before manually changing or removing runtime data.
