## Original DotClk clock fonts

`DotClk/ALTERN8.fnt`, `FISHY.fnt`, `TREK.fnt`, and `TWILIGHT.fnt` are the original
DotClk clock resources. They are embedded into the application assembly and are not
copied to the external `fonts/` directory. The application preserves the original
digit and clock glyphs and supplies its own dot-matrix date separators where a font
does not contain them.

- Original author/repository: sigmafx, https://github.com/sigmafx/DotClk-Resources
- Source directory: `Fonts/`
- Source commit: `11211af85a2ade66d05d961839773a05a01bddcc`
- Format: DotClk version 1, four-bit bitmap font
- Upstream repository does not currently include an explicit license file

The project currently keeps these four files embedded so the original clock faces
work without a separate download. This is an explicit temporary project decision,
not a claim that the files have an open-source or redistribution license. Their
origin and unchanged file hashes are recorded below.

## Pinball by Fontalicious

The Pinball OpenType family (Pinball, Galaxy, Scrambler, Scrambler II and Wizard) was downloaded separately for evaluation from https://www.fontalicious.com/fonts/pinball. The source page describes it as a free download but asks users to contact Fontalicious for commercial use. These `.otf` files are not bundled or redistributed until their applicable rights have been confirmed.
