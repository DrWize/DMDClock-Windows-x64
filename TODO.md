# DMDClock for Windows x64 — development TODO

This file is both the contributor runbook and the prioritized backlog. The active
sections contain only unfinished work. Finished items remain in the completed-work
archive so decisions and implementation history are not lost.

## Project goal and scope

DMDClock is a standalone Windows clock and animation player for the classic DotClk
format. It renders a 128×32, four-bit monochrome DMD on a normal monitor and does
not require a Raspberry Pi, Teensy, ESP32, or physical DMD.

Active development is limited to:

- classic 128×32 `.scn` playback;
- storyboard timing, masks, blanking, and clock layers;
- clocks, dates, DotClk/OpenType fonts, and classic DMD themes;
- library indexing, metadata, selection, controls, and Windows packaging.

Audio is outside scope. Serum, cRom, full RGB, larger displays, DMD Extensions,
Raspberry Pi, ESP32-S3, and physical-output support are deferred until the classic
Windows application is release-ready.

## Current baseline

The application, Windows screensaver, portable ZIP, standalone single-file ZIP,
per-user installer, shared scene selection, and live Scene Reviewer are functional.
Automated tests cover SCN parsing/playback, settings, embedded DotClk fonts,
screensaver arguments, library indexing, selection persistence, scene downloads,
and compatibility reporting.

The remaining release blockers are manual Windows validation, read-only-directory
testing, translation fallback behavior, and confirmation that the original DotClk
fonts can be redistributed publicly.

## End-user setup — no source code or SDK required

If you only want to install and use DMDClock, follow this section and stop before
**First-time developer setup**. You do not need Git, PowerShell, Visual Studio, or
the .NET SDK.

### 1. Choose a Windows package

Download a published ZIP from the project's GitHub Releases page. Do not download
GitHub's automatic **Source code** ZIP unless you intend to compile the project.

| Package | Recommended for | What must stay together |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DMDClock-win-x64-standalone.zip` | Most users | EXE/SCR plus the external `i18n` and optional `fonts` folders |
| `DMDClock-win-x64-portable.zip` | Troubleshooting or conventional self-contained deployment | The complete extracted directory, including every DLL |

The standalone package is recommended. Its EXE and SCR contain the .NET runtime,
Avalonia, native graphics libraries, and the four DotClk fonts. The regular portable
package uses adjacent DLL files; all of those DLLs are required and must not be
deleted.

### 2. Extract the complete ZIP

1. Right-click the downloaded ZIP and open **Properties**.
2. If Windows shows **Unblock**, select it and click **OK**.
3. Select **Extract All**. Do not run DMDClock from inside the ZIP.
4. Extract to a stable location you control, for example:

```text
C:\Users\<your-name>\Apps\DMDClock\
D:\Apps\DMDClock\
```

Avoid a temporary/download directory because the screensaver installation continues
to use `DMDClock.scr` from its extracted location. Keep the complete extracted
folder after installing the screensaver.

The extracted standalone folder should contain at least:

```text
DmdClock.App.exe
DMDClock.scr
i18n\
fonts\
scenes\scene-metadata.json
README.md
build-info.json
SCN-COMPATIBILITY.txt
SHA256SUMS.txt
```

### 3. Verify the standalone download

Open PowerShell in the extracted directory and compare these hashes with
`SHA256SUMS.txt`:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\DmdClock.App.exe -Algorithm SHA256
Get-FileHash .\DMDClock.scr -Algorithm SHA256
Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Only continue through a SmartScreen warning when the package came from the expected
project release and its checksum is trusted. Do not bypass a warning for an
unverified download.

### 4. Start DMDClock for the first time

1. Double-click `DmdClock.App.exe`.
2. Right-click anywhere on the DMD display to open the menu.
3. Choose **Appearance → Clock → Font** and select a clock face.
4. Choose **Appearance → Date → Font** if you want a different date face.
5. Configure color, brightness, glow, clock format, seconds, and date format.
6. Press `T` to show time, `D` to show the date, and `F11` for fullscreen.

Settings are saved automatically under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\settings.json
```

### 5. Add animations

Animations are not included in either ZIP and must be obtained separately.

Use any of these setups:

- right-click DMDClock and choose **Download DotClk scenes…** to download the
  original scene pack into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\Scenes\DotClk\`;
- create a `scenes` folder beside `DmdClock.App.exe` and copy `.scn` files into it; or
- press `Ctrl+Shift+O` and select an existing animation directory anywhere on the computer.

Subdirectories are scanned recursively. Press `F5` after adding or replacing files.
The app skips damaged files, keeps valid files available, and writes details to:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\logs\dmdclock.log
```

Optional files:

- update the bundled `scene-metadata.json` only with reviewed game/sequence data;
- put extra `.ttf` or `.otf` files anywhere under the extracted `fonts` directory;
- keep `i18n\en.json` and any selected translation beside the binaries.

ALTERN8, FISHY, TREK, and TWILIGHT are already embedded; do not download separate
`.fnt` files for normal use.

### 6. Configure automatic playback

From the right-click menu:

1. enable **Automatic clock/animation cycle**;
2. choose sequential or random order;
3. choose animations per cycle;
4. choose clock duration and the pause between animations;
5. press `T` to start from the clock.

The selected scene directory and playback preferences persist after restart.
Use **Review and choose scenes…** (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) to enable games and allow the
individual animations used by both the normal app and screensaver.

### 7. Install the Windows screensaver

1. Close DMDClock.
2. Right-click `DMDClock.scr` in the extracted folder.
3. Choose **Install**.
4. Select DMDClock in **Windows Screen Saver Settings**.
5. Set the Windows wait time and use **Preview** to test it.
6. Run `DmdClock.App.exe` or `DMDClock.scr /c` whenever you need to change DMDClock settings.

Do not move, rename, or delete the extracted folder after installation. If it must
move, select another screensaver first, move the folder, and install the SCR again.

The screensaver shares the normal application's scene directory and AppData settings.
It exits on a key, click, or deliberate mouse movement.

### 8. Upgrade without losing settings

1. Close DMDClock and select another Windows screensaver temporarily.
2. Extract the new ZIP into a new stable directory.
3. Copy only your portable `scenes`, optional user fonts, and custom translation
   files from the old directory.
4. Start the new `DmdClock.App.exe` and verify the version in `build-info.json`.
5. Reinstall the new `DMDClock.scr`.
6. Delete the old extracted directory only after the new build works.

Preferences and an externally selected scene directory remain under AppData, so
they normally survive an upgrade without copying.

### 9. Common setup problems

- **The EXE reports missing DLLs:** the regular portable package was used without
  all adjacent files. Extract the complete ZIP again or use the standalone package.
- **Menus show internal key names:** restore the package's complete `i18n` folder
  beside the EXE.
- **No animations appear:** confirm the chosen directory contains `.scn` files,
  then press `F5` and check the log for rejected files.
- **A new font does not appear:** place `.ttf`/`.otf` under `fonts`, then reopen the
  right-click menu.
- **The screensaver preview cannot start:** reinstall `DMDClock.scr` from its final
  stable location and keep the package files in place.
- **Settings need to be reset:** close DMDClock, back up
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock`, then remove `settings.json`. The app recreates defaults
  on the next start.
- **The screen is blank:** press `T`, restore brightness to 100%, select Classic
  orange, and verify the foreground/background colors are different.

## First-time developer setup

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 x64
- Git
- .NET 10 SDK
- PowerShell 7 recommended
- VS Code optional; full Visual Studio is not required

Check the tools before restoring:

```powershell
git --version
dotnet --info
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

Clone and enter the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DrWize/DMDClock-Windows-x64.git
Set-Location DMDClock-Windows-x64
```

Restore, build, test, and run:

```powershell
dotnet restore DMDClock.sln
dotnet build DMDClock.sln -c Debug
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release
dotnet run --project .\src\DmdClock.App\DmdClock.App.csproj
```

The application works without downloaded original resources. Add `.scn` files to
`.\scenes`, choose another directory with `Ctrl+Shift+O`, or use the optional
resource workflow below.

### Local .NET SDK override

`scripts/Build.ps1` looks for the SDK in this order:

1. the executable specified by `DMD_DOTNET`;
2. `..\.tools\dotnet10\dotnet.exe` relative to the repository;
3. `dotnet` from `PATH`.

Example override:

```powershell
$env:DMD_DOTNET = 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe'
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -NoStart
```

## Optional original resources

Original repositories and animation files are not required for normal compilation.
The download script stores them under the Git-ignored `external\` directory and
writes reproducibility metadata there.

Download all missing reference repositories:

```powershell
.\scripts\Get-OriginalResources.ps1
```

Useful variants:

```powershell
# Download only the original scene/font resource repository.
.\scripts\Get-OriginalResources.ps1 -Resource DotClk-Resources

# Fast-forward existing clean repositories and report changes.
.\scripts\Get-OriginalResources.ps1 -Update

# Preview an update without changing files.
.\scripts\Get-OriginalResources.ps1 -Update -WhatIf

# Replace selected local repositories with fresh clones.
.\scripts\Get-OriginalResources.ps1 -Resource DotClk-Resources -Redownload
```

Do not use `-Redownload` when an external repository contains local work that has
not been copied elsewhere. See `docs\SOURCES.md` for sources and safety details.

## Common development commands

### Build and test

```powershell
dotnet build DMDClock.sln -c Debug
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release
```

Run one test class while iterating:

```powershell
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release --filter FullyQualifiedName~DotClkFont
```

Run the application from source:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\DmdClock.App\DmdClock.App.csproj
```

### Inspect an SCN collection

`scan` reads every `.scn` recursively and reports accepted, warned, and rejected
files. It exits with code `1` when any file is rejected.

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\tools\DmdClock.Tools\DmdClock.Tools.csproj -- scan .\scenes
```

`index` exercises the library scanner and reports the same high-level counts:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\tools\DmdClock.Tools\DmdClock.Tools.csproj -- index .\scenes
```

Use `Ctrl+O` in the application to test one file. Use `F5` after adding files to the
active library.

### Generate RD scene metadata

This script matches local `RD####.scn` files against the original `RD Index.txt`
and writes `scenes\scene-metadata.json`.

Prerequisites:

- `external\DotClk-Resources\RD Index.txt` exists;
- matching `RD*.scn` files exist under `scenes\`.

```powershell
.\scripts\Map-RdScenes.ps1
```

Override paths when the index or scene library is elsewhere:

```powershell
.\scripts\Map-RdScenes.ps1 `
  -IndexPath 'D:\DotClk\RD Index.txt' `
  -ScenesDirectory 'D:\DMD Scenes' `
  -MetadataPath 'D:\DMD Scenes\scene-metadata.json'
```

### Render DotClk font previews

The preview script reads the original `.fnt` files and produces one PNG per font:

```powershell
.\scripts\Render-DotClkFontPreviews.ps1
```

Default input and output:

```text
external\DotClk-Resources\Fonts\
output\font-previews\
```

### Create distributable Windows builds

Recommended non-interactive release build:

```powershell
dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -NoStart
```

Run and start the newly published regular application:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build.ps1
```

Useful build options:

```powershell
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Configuration Debug -NoStart
.\scripts\Build.ps1 -Runtime win-x64 -MaxArchivedBuilds 20 -NoStart
```

`Build.ps1` has intentional side effects:

- closes running `DmdClock.App.exe`, `DMDClock.scr`, and related tool processes;
- publishes regular self-contained and standalone single-file builds;
- copies the existing regular-build scene library forward;
- runs the SCN compatibility scan;
- creates reports, checksums, and both ZIP packages;
- archives the previous current builds;
- retains 10 archive directories by default and permanently removes older ones.

Build outputs:

```text
output\current\win-x64\
output\current\win-x64\DMDClock-win-x64-portable.zip
output\current\win-x64-standalone\
output\current\win-x64-standalone\DMDClock-win-x64-standalone.zip
output\archive\
```

Do not distribute files directly from `output\.staging\`. A successful build moves
the completed packages into `output\current\`.

## Runtime files and local data

External files beside a published build:

- `i18n\*.json` — translations; required for localized menus;
- `fonts\**\*.ttf` and `*.otf` — optional user-installed fonts;
- `scenes\**\*.scn` — optional portable scene library;
- `scenes\scene-metadata.json` — optional game/sequence metadata.

ALTERN8, FISHY, TREK, and TWILIGHT are embedded and require no adjacent `.fnt`
files. Downloaded scenes remain external to the standalone EXE and SCR.

Writable runtime data is stored under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\
```

- `settings.json` — saved preferences and selected paths;
- `library-index.json` — incremental library index;
- `library-selections.json` — enabled games and Allowed, Disallowed, or Unreviewed
  scene decisions shared by the app and screensaver;
- `logs\dmdclock.log` — active log;
- `logs\dmdclock.log.previous` — rotated log.

Generated and local-only directories such as `bin\`, `obj\`, `external\`, `output\`,
and scene content are ignored by Git.

## Manual Windows test checklist

Before calling a build release-ready:

- [ ] Extract each ZIP into a new empty directory; do not run from inside the ZIP
- [ ] Start regular `DmdClock.App.exe` and standalone `DmdClock.App.exe`
- [ ] Verify the built-in clock works with no `scenes` directory
- [ ] Select ALTERN8, FISHY, TREK, and TWILIGHT independently for time and date
- [ ] Verify 12/24-hour time, seconds on/off, and every date format
- [ ] Load valid, warned, unsupported, and damaged SCN samples
- [ ] Verify automatic cycles, pause, next/previous, metadata, and rescanning
- [ ] Switch English/Swedish and test behavior with `i18n` missing
- [ ] Verify settings and the library index are written only to AppData
- [ ] Run from a read-only installation directory
- [ ] Confirm `SHA256SUMS.txt` matches both standalone binaries
- [ ] Check startup time, temporary native extraction, package size, SmartScreen,
      and antivirus results

Screensaver checks:

```powershell
& .\output\current\win-x64-standalone\DMDClock.scr /c
& .\output\current\win-x64-standalone\DMDClock.scr /s
```

- [ ] Verify `/c` opens configuration mode
- [ ] Verify `/s` opens fullscreen and exits on keyboard, click, or deliberate mouse movement
- [ ] Right-click `DMDClock.scr`, choose **Install**, and select it in Windows Screen Saver Settings
- [ ] Verify the Control Panel `/p <HWND>` preview is embedded and closes cleanly
- [ ] Repeat standalone tests on clean Windows 10 and Windows 11 x64 machines
      without an installed .NET runtime

## Definition of done

A completed item must include:

- implementation and focused automated tests;
- the full `dotnet test DMDClock.sln -c Release` suite passing;
- relevant manual UI or screensaver validation;
- documentation for new commands, settings, resources, or output files;
- no downloaded animations, ROMs, secrets, or generated output staged in Git;
- a checked item moved from active work to the completed archive.

## Active roadmap

### Priority 1 — release validation and robustness

- [ ] Provide an English built-in translation fallback and a clear warning when
      external translations are missing or invalid
- [ ] Ensure startup and normal operation never require write access beside the executable
- [ ] Complete every item in the manual Windows test checklist above
- [ ] Confirm redistribution terms for ALTERN8, FISHY, TREK, and TWILIGHT before
      publishing a public binary release; until then, keep the files embedded with
      their sigmafx source, source commit, hashes, and unresolved license status documented
- [ ] Verify SmartScreen and antivirus behavior for both EXE and SCR
- [ ] Consider trimming only after the untrimmed standalone build passes all release tests

Acceptance criteria:

- both ZIPs work from read-only directories on clean Windows 10/11 x64;
- the screensaver works in `/s`, `/c`, installed, and Control Panel preview modes;
- missing optional scenes/fonts and missing or invalid translations do not crash startup;
- all writable data stays under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock`.

### Priority 2 — VS Code development setup

- [ ] Add `.vscode\extensions.json` with the required/recommended C# tooling
- [ ] Add `.vscode\tasks.json` for restore, build, test, run, compatibility scan,
      and release packaging
- [ ] Add `.vscode\launch.json` for debugging the Avalonia application
- [ ] Verify every VS Code task has an equivalent documented PowerShell command
- [ ] Add troubleshooting for SDK discovery, missing resources, bad SCN files,
      graphics problems, and locked build output

Acceptance criteria:

- a fresh clone can be restored, tested, run, and debugged from VS Code without
  full Visual Studio or user-specific project files.

### Priority 3 — animation-library selection

- [x] Define the persisted selection schema before building the UI
- [ ] Add manufacturer → game → animation browsing with search
- [ ] Add `Select all`, `Clear all`, and `Reset`
- [x] Enable/disable a game or individual animation
- [x] Preserve selections and blocked animations across rescans and restarts
- [x] Preserve selections when files are added, changed, moved, or removed
- [ ] Support all enabled animations, manufacturer, game, random, sequential,
      and chronological playback modes
- [x] Show a live rendered preview and basic metadata for the selected animation
- [ ] Add focused migration, persistence, and playback-selection tests

#### Metadata packaging and GitHub updates

- [x] Keep the verified baseline `scenes/scene-metadata.json` in source control while
      continuing to ignore proprietary `.scn` animation files
- [x] Include the baseline metadata JSON in every regular ZIP, standalone EXE package,
      screensaver package, and installer build so a clean clone and every published
      build have useful metadata without a separate download
- [ ] Load metadata in layers: bundled baseline, newer validated GitHub update, then
      optional library-local overrides, with later layers overriding matching entries
- [ ] Add a versioned GitHub metadata manifest containing schema version, metadata
      version, publication time, download URL, and SHA-256 checksum
- [ ] Add **Check for metadata updates…** to the regular app and screensaver
      configuration mode; download updates over HTTPS, validate schema and checksum,
      and replace the AppData copy atomically only after complete validation
- [ ] Store downloaded metadata under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\metadata\`, retain the
      bundled version as an offline fallback, and retain the last known-good downloaded
      version when an update is missing, damaged, incompatible, or unavailable
- [ ] Make regular app and screensaver playback observe the same validated metadata
      update without requiring either installation directory to be writable
- [x] Display a release year only when the exact pinball identity and year are verified;
      omit the year entirely when it is missing or uncertain and never infer or guess it
- [ ] Add a GitHub issue form for metadata additions and corrections requiring game,
      exact machine/version, release year, affected files or RD range, and a reliable
      evidence link; only reviewed data may enter the published metadata
- [ ] Add packaging, precedence, offline fallback, checksum failure, schema migration,
      concurrent reload, and clean-build metadata tests

#### Main application selection

- [ ] Add a dedicated **Choose games and scenes…** window to the main DMDClock
      application, opened from the context menu without cluttering the clock display
- [ ] Show enabled games and the allowed scenes for the selected game side by side,
      with search, per-game scene counts, and `Select all`, `Clear all`, and `Reset`
- [x] Use strict allowlist behavior: only valid scenes explicitly marked `Allowed`
      under an enabled game may enter the playback queue; `Unreviewed` and
      `Disallowed` scenes must not play
- [x] Keep individual scene decisions when a game is disabled so re-enabling the game
      restores the same allowed scenes
- [x] Store stable scene ID, last relative path, and SHA-256 fallback information so
      decisions survive renames, moves, temporary removal, restoration, and rescans
- [x] Make the main selector and Scene Reviewer read and write the same atomic
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DmdClock\library-selections.json` selection document
- [x] Apply the same selection resolver and shared selection document to both regular
      DMDClock playback and fullscreen screensaver playback at the same time
- [x] Watch the shared selection document for atomic changes so an already-running app
      or screensaver safely refreshes its playback queue at the next scene boundary
      without requiring a restart
- [x] Make the selector and Scene Reviewer available from the regular app and
      screensaver configuration mode while keeping fullscreen `/s` playback free of
      configuration controls
- [x] Put selection models, persistence, reconciliation, catalog building, filtering,
      and playback-list generation in `DmdClock.Core`; keep the selector and reviewer
      windows plus rendering behavior in `DmdClock.App`

#### Scene Reviewer

- [x] Add a small dedicated Scene Reviewer interface that groups the installed
      animations by game and places every scene for the selected game in a tiled wall
- [x] Run all scenes on the current page simultaneously and loop them independently
      using the real DMD renderer, compositor, and working clock
- [x] Support `Unreviewed`, `Allowed`, and `Disallowed` states with one-click
      Allow/Disallow controls and an obvious overlay on disallowed tiles
- [ ] Change tile mouse controls so left-click toggles `Allowed` ↔ `Unreviewed`
      and right-click toggles `Disallowed` ↔ `Unreviewed`; clicking the opposite
      decision directly replaces it, so left-click on Disallowed becomes Allowed
      and right-click on Allowed becomes Disallowed
- [ ] Add **Allow remaining Unreviewed** actions for the current page, current game,
      and entire library so the reviewer can right-click only bad scenes and approve
      every remaining scene in one batch; never change existing Disallowed decisions,
      show the affected count, and require confirmation for the entire-library action
- [x] Save every review decision immediately and make DMDClock playback use only
      animations allowed by the persisted library selection
- [x] Add separate numeric `Columns` and `Rows` controls starting at `1 × 1`, with
      independent increment/decrement controls and `columns × rows` scenes per page
- [ ] Preserve the 128×32 DMD aspect ratio, resize tiles to fill the available window,
      remember the chosen rows and columns, and provide an optional automatic-fit mode
- [ ] Add previous/next-page controls, scene ranges, and per-game plus overall counts
      for allowed, disallowed, and unreviewed animations
- [ ] Add filters for all, allowed, disallowed, and unreviewed scenes, plus pause,
      replay, and enlarged single-scene inspection
- [x] Keep large game groups responsive by using a shared render timer and rendering
      the tiled wall efficiently rather than creating one timer per scene
- [ ] Add tests for grid sizing, pagination, immediate persistence, state restoration,
      filtering, and propagation of Allow/Disallow decisions into playback

Acceptance criteria:

- every clean and published app/screensaver build contains a verified baseline metadata
  JSON and continues working when GitHub is unavailable;
- an invalid or interrupted metadata update can never replace the last known-good copy;
- verified GitHub metadata updates become available to both app and screensaver without
  modifying installed files or user selection decisions;
- adding new files never resets existing enablement or block choices;
- every playback mode uses only the active selection and skips invalid files;
- disabling and re-enabling a game restores its previous individual scene decisions;
- a newly discovered or unreviewed scene never starts playing without explicit approval;
- the main selector, reviewer, and playback queue always resolve the same saved state;
- regular app and screensaver playback use the same selection concurrently and refresh
  safely after a saved change without interrupting the scene currently playing;
- every visible reviewer tile plays the complete scene with a working clock;
- repeated left-clicks alternate only between Allowed and Unreviewed, repeated
  right-clicks alternate only between Disallowed and Unreviewed, and switching
  mouse button replaces the previous decision;
- batch approval changes only Unreviewed scenes to Allowed, preserves every
  Disallowed scene, and avoids requiring an individual click for every good scene;
- changing rows or columns immediately rebuilds the page without losing decisions.

### Priority 4 — display and daily operation

- [ ] Select and persist the target monitor
- [ ] Recover gracefully when the selected monitor is disconnected
- [ ] Add start-with-Windows and always-on-top options
- [ ] Add a discreet paused indicator
- [ ] Add explicit enable/disable settings for clock, date, and animations
- [ ] Add an optional weekday display
- [ ] Add a system-tray icon with pause, show clock, next animation, and exit
- [ ] Resume the last safe mode after restart or power failure
- [ ] Export/import settings and create an automatic pre-migration backup
- [ ] Add a diagnostics view for file, frame, timing, resolution, and decoder errors
- [ ] Add silent fullscreen error handling that logs and skips broken content

### Priority 5 — installer and release automation

- [x] Select Inno Setup and add a conventional non-admin per-user installer
- [x] Package standalone `DmdClock.App.exe`, `DMDClock.scr`, translations, font,
      reports, checksums, and user documentation
- [x] Add Start Menu shortcuts plus optional Desktop and automatic-start shortcuts
- [x] Add installed instructions plus Start Menu and finish-page links showing
      where and how to obtain original DotClk `.scn` files
- [x] Add optional screensaver activation that restores the previous screensaver on uninstall
- [x] Add `scripts\Build-Installer.ps1`, installer checksums, metadata, and archiving
- [x] Complete automated silent install, screensaver registration, repeat-install,
      checksum, AppData-preservation, and uninstall tests
- [ ] Test an in-place upgrade from an older installer build
- [ ] Test the interactive installer on clean Windows 10 and Windows 11 without .NET
- [ ] Decide code-signing and release-checksum procedures
- [ ] Add the signed setup EXE to a repeatable GitHub release workflow

Detailed status, commands, and acceptance criteria:
[`docs/INSTALLER.md`](docs/INSTALLER.md).
